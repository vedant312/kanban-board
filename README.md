This is a kanban board app built with React. It is a simple app that allows you to group and sort tasks into columns. It is built in pure react without any external css libraries with love.

## Key Points

- Built in pure react without any external css libraries.
- Fetches data only once per load from API.
- Saves group by and sort order in local storage.
- First tickets grouping is done and then sorting is done asynchronously within each group.
- Sorting smaller groups is faster than sorting larger groups.
- Async sorting tasks also accelerate the rendering of the app.
- UI design is as close to the given design as possible.
- React icons are used for icons.
- Avatars are used from github user contents
